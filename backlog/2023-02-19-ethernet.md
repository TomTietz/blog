## Introduction


## Cables

To understand the differences between ethernet cabling standards and wthe consequences for the user they entail you need to understand a lot of ternms that might be new to you. The following definitions hsould give yoiu a good overview of the most important ones.

### Copper vs Optical Fiber



### Coaxial, Twisted Pair, UTP and STP

When handling Ethernet cables you will at one see one of these descriptors printed on a cable. Knowing what they mean is crucial for picking the right cable for the right environment. Essentiually they are all variations of good ol' copper cabling with some minor differences

- **Coaxial**: A cable with  a single central conductor surrounded by insulation plus often a braided shield and/or an outer jacket. It supports long distances and high frequencies and is commonly used for cable television and internet connections.
- **Twisted Pair**: A cable consisting one or multiuple pairs of wires which are individually insulated and twisted around each other. This design is helps against electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk and makes installation easier, as it is often thinner than coax. However, because they are thinner, twisted pair cables can not support very long runs like coax cables. Most importantly it is cheaper to produce than coaxial.
- **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)**: A tpye of twisted pair cabling that does not have any shielding.
- **Shielded Twisted Pair (UTP)**: A tpye of twisted pair cabling that does have shielding. There are various types of shielding material which can be installed around the whole cable or each pair of wires or even both but we will not dive deeper into this here. If you are interested in the shielding types you can look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair#Cable_shielding) but for now it is enough if you understand that shielding helps against EMI.
UTP cabling with four pairs (8 wires) is the usual cabling of choice for all copper-based Ethernet standards but STP is often used in situations where EMI would be an issue.

### Broadband vs Baseband

Both terms describe how data is transmitted between two nodes. Baseband technology transmits a single data signal (usually frequency) at a time while broadband technology transmits multiple data signals simultaneously at the same time. This differentiation applies to both copper cabling and fiber optical cabling. Broadband cabling is used for high-speed data transmission over long distances, typically over a coaxial cable. It is usually used for wide-area networks which is why many refer to the internet connection provided by your ISP as broadband. When working with Ethernet you only deal with baseband transmissions yet it still helps to understand both terms as you will inevitably stumble over the terms frequently.

| Disadvantages      | Limited data transmission capacity, shorter transmission distance, less secure | Complex and expensive, signal interference, requires specialized equipment |

### Single-mode vs Multi-mode Fiber

Single-mode fiber and multi-mode fiber are two types of optical fibers. 
Single-mode fiber has a small core diameter of around 8-10 microns, which allows only a single mode of light to propagate through it. This means that the signal travels in a straight line, without bouncing around inside the core of the fiber. Single-mode fiber is used in long-distance applications such as telecommunications and cable television because it can transmit data over much greater distances than multi-mode fiber. Due to the cost and more complicated handling associated with it single-mode fiber is usally only used where it is necessary. Local area networks (LANs), data centers and shorter distance applications in general use the cheaper and more robust multi-mode fiber.
Multi-mode fiber has a larger core diameter of around 50-100 microns, which allows multiple modes of light to propagate through it. This means that the signal can bounce around inside the core of the fiber, resulting in some signal loss and distortion. Due to its larger core diameter it is also more robust and easier to install.

| Bandwidth     | High              | Lower than single-mode   |
| Distance      | Long distance     | Short to medium distance |

| Signal Loss   | Low               | Higher than single-mode  |
| Dispersion    | Low               | Higher than single-mode  |
| Installation  | More difficult    | Easier                   |
